March 21st, 1917, marked the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, \r\nwhose tenure focused on consolidating power and implementing reforms. \r\nThe assassination of Emiliano Zapata on 04/10/1919, deeply impacted the revolution, particularly the agrarian movement. \r\nFinally, on 05-21-1920, Álvaro Obregón led a successful revolt against Carranza's government, resulting in his presidency. \r\nThese important dates highlight key moments in the Mexican Revolution's trajectory, shaping the course of Mexico's future.\r\n"
